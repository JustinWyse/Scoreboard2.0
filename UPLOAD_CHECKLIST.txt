GITHUB UPLOAD CHECKLIST
========================================

📁 WHAT'S IN THIS FOLDER:
All the files you need to upload to GitHub for your Scoreboard dashboard.

========================================
🚀 UPLOAD INSTRUCTIONS
========================================

OPTION 1 - Upload ALL files at once (EASIEST):
1. Go to: https://github.com/JustinWyse/Scoreboard2.0
2. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
3. Drag ALL files from this folder into GitHub
4. Click "Commit changes"
5. Wait 1-2 minutes for Streamlit to redeploy

OPTION 2 - Replace just the data file:
1. Go to: https://github.com/JustinWyse/Scoreboard2.0
2. Click on "data.json.gz"
3. Click trash icon to delete it
4. Go back to main page
5. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
6. Upload ONLY the data.json.gz from your local folder:
   Desktop\front_dashboard_final\data.json.gz
7. Click "Commit changes"

========================================
📋 FILES YOU NEED TO UPLOAD
========================================

REQUIRED FILES (Must upload these):
✅ streamlit_app.py          - Main app
✅ index.html                - Dashboard HTML
✅ styles.css                - Styling
✅ app.js                    - JavaScript
✅ category_analysis.js      - Category functions
✅ category_aliases.json     - Category mappings
✅ requirements.txt          - Python dependencies
✅ README.md                 - Documentation
✅ .gitignore                - Git ignore rules

HELPER FILES (Nice to have):
✅ UPDATE_DATA.bat           - Batch file to update data
✅ update_data.py            - Python conversion script
✅ QUICK_START.md            - Quick start guide

DATA FILE (MOST IMPORTANT):
❗ data.json.gz              - YOUR DASHBOARD DATA
   ⚠️  UPLOAD FROM YOUR LOCAL FOLDER, NOT FROM HERE!
   📂 Location: Desktop\front_dashboard_final\data.json.gz
   
   This file is NOT in this folder because you need the 
   LATEST version with 43,274 rows from your local folder.

========================================
⚠️  IMPORTANT NOTES
========================================

1. DO NOT upload "data.json.gz" from this folder!
   Use the one from: Desktop\front_dashboard_final\data.json.gz
   (The one you just created with UPDATE_DATA.bat)

2. After uploading, Streamlit Cloud takes 1-2 minutes to redeploy

3. Check your dashboard at your Streamlit Cloud URL

4. The record count should show 43,274 (or your latest count)

========================================
🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING
========================================

Dashboard won't load:
- Check that ALL files were uploaded
- Check that data.json.gz is the NEW version
- Wait 2 minutes for Streamlit to finish deploying

Wrong data showing:
- You uploaded the wrong data.json.gz
- Upload the one from: Desktop\front_dashboard_final\data.json.gz

Files look weird on GitHub:
- Some files (like .gitignore) might be hidden
- That's normal - they're still there

========================================
✅ VERIFICATION
========================================

After uploading, verify:
1. All files show "just now" or today's date on GitHub
2. Streamlit dashboard loads without errors
3. Record count matches your expected number
4. Data looks correct when you filter

========================================
📞 NEED HELP?
========================================

If something isn't working:
1. Check that you uploaded data.json.gz from your LOCAL folder
2. Wait 2 minutes for Streamlit to redeploy
3. Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. Check Streamlit Cloud deployment logs for errors
