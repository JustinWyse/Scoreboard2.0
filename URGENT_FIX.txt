===================================

❌ WHAT WAS BROKEN IN 2.0:

  ✓ UI polish

📤 UPLOAD THESE 3 FILES NOW:
1. app.js       (CRITICAL FIX)
2. styles.css   (Same as 2.0)
3. index.html   (Same as 2.0)

⚡ QUICK UPLOAD:
1. Go to: https://github.com/JustinWyse/Scoreboard2.0
2. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
3. Drag all 3 files
4. Click "Commit changes"
5. Wait 2 minutes

✅ AFTER UPLOAD YOU'LL SEE:

Sorry for the issue! This will fix it immediately.

🎯 THE PROBLEM:
Line 1624-1627 in app.js had leftover code from the old version that created a syntax error. I've removed it and verified the JavaScript is now valid.

⏱️ Total time to fix: 5 minutes
